Welcome to Etch-A-Sketch!

Your cursor starts at the top left of your window (no matter what the size). You can move the cursor using the arrow keys. When moving the cursor, the "drawing" (an asterik character) will follow your cursor position You can also clear the window using your 'c' key. The cursor will remain in the same position upon clearing. Lastly, you can exit by pressing the 'q' key. Thank you and enjoy!
